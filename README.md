# MVEL expressions in series query

The `evaluate` series query field specifies how collected series should be processed with user defined MVEL expression.

View the details and examples of MVEL expressions in series query [here](./udf.md).

Examples make use of series data inserted in ATSD by the following [commands](./series-commands.txt).

To curb the MVEL expressions beast read the [javadocs](https://axibase.com/files/eval/javadocs/) which describe functions and variables available in evaluation context.
